    role: 'CEO & Founder',
    bio: `Mr. Kofi Boakye Yiadom is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Ricky Boakye Yiadom Limited, one of the most respected and high-performing distributors of Guinness Ghana Breweries PLC. Since establishing the company in 1986, he has led it through decades of growth and transformation, positioning it as a cornerstone in distribution in Ghana’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) landscape.
A voracious autodidact and master of experiential learning, he is revered for his eloquence and fondness for sesquipedalian vocabulary, often delivering powerful business insights wrapped in grandiloquent diction that commands attention and admiration. He lives by a personal ethos that greatness is forged through continuous learning, adaptation, and vision.
Under his leadership, Ricky Boakye Yiadom Ltd. has achieved numerous milestones, including countless awards from Guinness Ghana Breweries PLC, which includes annual overall best platinum distributor and several awards repeatedly in products distribution.
In 2010, he was appointed by the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, to the Board of Directors of Asante Kotoko S.C. (2010/2013). A prestigious role entrusted to him by the King himself, in recognition of his loyalty, leadership, and contribution to Asanteman.
Mr. Boakye Yiadom also ventured into telecommunications, having been approached by Tigo Ghana and Airtel Ghana to spearhead strategic retail partnerships. This led to the establishment of Micromobile Links (Kumasi-based GSM distribution and activation hub) and Lesleywaves (a retail outlet in Accra for Airtel Ghana). Though both telecom ventures were eventually phased out, they reflected his natural ability to identify opportunity, diversify intelligently, and lead with boldness.
Today, he continues to lead Ricky Boakye Yiadom Limited with wisdom, integrity, and unwavering commitment to legacy and regional impact, remaining a highly respected figure in both the business and traditional leadership circles of the Ashanti Region. Kofi Boakye Yiadom is the longest distributor for Guinness Ghana Breweries PLC.
“The antithesis of stagnation is education and in this life, one must never cease to retool the mind.” Mr. Kofi Boakye Yiadom`,
